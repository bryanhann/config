USAGE

        $(basename $1) FILE LINE

DESCRIPTION

        Append LINE to FILE.

        Typically used to ensure that a sourced dotfile ends by sourcing
        another dotfile, as in

        $(basename $1) ~/.profile "source ~/foo/.profile"

        The appended LINE is itself augmented by a comment with a magic string, 
        and before appending the given LINE all lines containing that magic string
        are stripped from the given FILE.

INTENDED USE-CASE

	Reliably having a dotfile end by sourcing either "foo/bar" (say) or "zot/yak" (say)
        depending on the needs of the moment.

EXAMPLE

        $ cat path/to/file
	        line1
	        line2
        $ $(basename $1) path/to/file "source foo/bar"
        $ cat path/to/file
	        line1
	        line2
	        source foo/bar
        $ echo line3 >> path/to/file
        $ cat path/to/file
	        line1
	        line2
	        source foo/bar # <MAGIC>
	        line3
        $ $(basename $1) path/to/file "source zot/yak"
        $ cat path/to/file
	        line1
	        line2
	        line3
	        source zot/yak # <MAGIC>
